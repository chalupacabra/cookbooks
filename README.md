Chef Cookbooks
==============

I'm the Intuit Chef Cookbooks library.  I contain recipes that have been tested on Red Hat 6.

How To Use This Library
-----------------------

This library is meant to save engineers the hours invested by others to write cookbooks for the common applications which are tested with our baseline.  The intention is this repository will be forked into your own source control and additionall application specific cookbooks added for your application.

Getting Started
---------------

**Liftoff**

The easiest way to get started and see some cookbooks in action is to start with the README in [Liftoff](https://github.com/intuit/liftoff).
