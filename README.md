Chef Cookbooks
==============

I'm the Intuit Chef Cookbooks Repository.  I am going to contain clean recipes that have been tested on Intuit certified baseline AMIs.

Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to get started is to launch the [single instance baseline template](https://raw.github.com/live-community/cloud_formation_templates/master/vpc/baseline/single_instance.json) from the [Cloud Formation Templates Repo](https://github.com/live-community/cloud_formation_templates) 

To get started without Cloud Formation, checkou the [Intuit Chef Starter Repo](https://github.com/live-community/chef-repo)
