Chef Cookbooks
==============

I'm the Intuit Chef Cookbooks Repository.  I am going to contain clean recipes that have been tested on Intuit (RHEL6) baseline AMIs.

Getting Started
---------------

**Cloud Formation**

The easiest way to get started is to launch the [Single Instance Baseline Template](https://raw.github.com/live-community/cloud_formation_templates/master/vpc/baseline/single_instance.json) from the [Cloud Formation Templates Repo](https://github.com/live-community/cloud_formation_templates). 

**Manually Provisioned Instance**

To get started without Cloud Formation, checkout the README in the [Intuit Chef Starter Repo](https://github.com/live-community/chef-repo/blob/master/README.md).
