Chef Cookbooks
==============

I'm the Intuit Chef Cookbooks library.  I contain recipes that have been tested on Red Hat 6.

How To Use This Library
-----------------------

This library is meant to save engineers the hours invested by others to write cookbooks for the common applications which are tested with our baseline.  The intention is this repository will be forked into your own source control and additionall application specific cookbooks added for your application.

Getting Started
---------------

**Cloud Formation**

The easiest way to get started is to launch the [Single Instance Baseline Template](https://github.com/intuit/cloud_formation_templates/blob/master/classic/single_instances/chef/base_instance_with_chef.json) from the [Cloud Formation Templates Repo](https://github.com/intuit/cloud_formation_templates).

For more information on getting started with Cloud Formation, see [AWS Agility Framework Wiki](https://github.com/intuit/aws-agility-framework/wiki/Getting-Started)

**Manually Provisioned Instance**

To get started without Cloud Formation, checkout the README in the [AWS Cloud Formation Templates](https://github.com/intuit/cloud_formation_templates/blob/master/README.md).
